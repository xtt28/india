            <p>
                After the fall of the Gupta Empire, the northern and southern sides
                of India had different political systems. Disunity was rampant, with
                constant power disputes occurring in the north and military enemies
                leveraging this.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But this division also had a good side: it led to the development
                of diverse cultures and literature. India had already inherited
                scriptures, language, a pantheon of gods, rituals, and a social
                class system from the Aryans, people who migrated to India around
                2000 BC. This culture inherited and advanced by the Indians would
                serve as the foundation for its future impact on its region.

            <p>
                Temporary unity was restored to northern India with the reign of
                Harsha, a leader known for his "piety, liberality, and even
                scholarship." While being attentive to political manners, he also
                cared about his subjects, supporting hospitals and regularly
                giving them great gifts.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Although he was a Buddhist, Harsha was acceptive of the faiths
                around him. Due to a decline in trade and commerce, guilds of
                traders and merchants were dissolved, so the economies of his
                kingdom were increasingly feudal and self-sufficient.
            </p>

            <p>
                King Harsha temporarily unified northern India thanks to his
                ability to hold relationships with the small states of the
                fragmented kingdom. Despite this, the kingdom fell rapidly
                upon his assassination, undoing the progress in unification that
                Harsha made.

            <p>
                Intending to harvest the wealth from its temples, Mahmud of Ghazni,
                a Turkic leader, "annexed several states in northwestern India and
                the Punjab" between 1001 and 1027, partially contributing to
                Buddhism's decline in India. Despite their destruction of Buddhist
                and Hindu sites and creation of Islamic structures, not many Indians
                converted to Islam.
            </p>

            <p>
                That changed in 1206, when Mahmud's successors established the
                sultanate of Delhi—an Islamic state in northern India. It peaked
                in the 14th century, being among the most powerful Islamic
                nations, while having limited authority outside of its center of
                power in Delhi. Islamic government still failed to gain prominence
                within India, with the sultans of Delhi exerting unstable and
                weak control over their subjects.
            </p>

            <p>
                The economy was largely centered on agricultural production;
                in addition, copper and silver coins were used as currency. In
                terms of religion, "the sultans prominently sponsored Islam and
                helped to establish a secure place for their faith in the
                cultural landscape of India."

            </div>

            <p>
                The kingdom of Chola emerged in the politically fragmented region
                of southern India. Local regions had a considerable amount of
                autonomy, with the kingdom having a mainly decentralized political
                system. During the kingdom's high point in the 11th century, its
                forces conquered Ceylon and some of southeast Asia.
            </p>

            <p>
                Hinduism was the main religion of the Cholas, although Buddhism
                and Jainism also gained some traction. The economy was
                strengthened by trade, contributing to elements such as a strong
                military. Despite this, the kingdom fell due to "native Sinhalese
                forces [expelling] Chola officials from Ceylon and revolts
                [erupting] in southern India."

            <p>
                The Kingdom of Vijayanagar, originating in 1336, was the second
                kingdom to control most of southern India. It was established
                by two brothers, Harisha and Bukka, dispatched from the
                Sultanate of Delhi to expand the kingdom to the south. Unlike
                the kingdom's intentions, the two brothers thought of this
                exploration as a chance to become powerful rulers of a new
                kingdom.
            </p>

            <p>
                To increase their popularity, the rulers stopped practicing
                Islam, returning to Hindu beliefs and earning the kingdom its
                name: Vijayanagar, meaning "city of victory." Despite this
                change and the kingdom's young age, they maintained excellent
                trade relationships with the Muslims, continuing their
                half-a-millennium bond.
            </p>

            <p>
                The Kingdom of Vijayanagar eventually fell to Mughal conquerors
                in 1565.
